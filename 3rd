plt.subplot provides a way to plot multiple plots on a single figure
plt.imshow: creates an image from 2 dimensional numpy array
plt.xticks gets current horizontal location
conv2D(32,(3,3),activation=relu)
here above first paramter is number of filters , size of fiters and for first layer will will take inpuit layer
maxpooling2d(2,2) it will take width and hieght
metrics: will indicate on which we have to evaluate our model
stochastic gradient descent is an optimazation algorithm often used in machine learning
app to find the model paramter that correspond to best fit betwn predicted and actual output
learning rate is default scheudule in all keras optimizer
mode.compile means to finalize the model and make for use
sparse_categorical_crossentropy : it is probable match for each value 
accuracy: calculate how often predictions equal labels
batch_size : it is number of samples processed before the model is updated
plt.figure:it is used for creating figures
random_choice: it will give random value from a sequence
squeeze-it will remove single-dimensional entries from shape of an array
