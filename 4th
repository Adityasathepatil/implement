autoencoder:it is an unsuperwised learning technique for neural networks that learns 
efficient data representations by training the network to ignore signals
autoencoders:are help to reduce the noise in data
pd.count_values:it return the unique set of values
tf.reduce_mean:it will give min along the vector
learning rate:amount that the weights are updated during training
drpoout:it is used to control overfitting
val_loss:value of cost function for your cross validation data
min_delta:minimum change in monitord quanity
patience is set to some parameter then epoch will terminate at that time
